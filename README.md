##Description

NetDefense is a tool used to defend IPv4 and IPv6 networks from possible attacks. This project helps to detect a small number of attacks that eventually will be incrased to provide a higher protection.

NetDefence is an Open Source project developed by a student of Computer Engineering, to apply the concepts learned at the university and to practice programming with Python.

List of attacks that can be protected:
- [x] MITM ARP Poisoning
- [x] DoS ARP Poisoning
- [x] MITM Neighbor Spoofing
- [ ] DoS Neighbor Spoofing
- [ ] MITM DHCP ACK Injection
- [ ] DoS DHCP ACK Injection
